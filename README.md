# CS50 Practice Exercises

This repository contains my lecture practice code and small exercises completed while following Harvard's CS50 course. 
These are not full problem sets, but small C programs used to learn foundational concepts and reinforce programming skills.

## Structure
- **Week 1:** Basic C concepts, conditions, and loops 
  - agree.c
  - calculator.c
  - compare.c
  - cat.c

## Purpose
- Reinforce core CS50 concepts
- Practice C programming syntax and logic

## How to Run
Compile each program individually using GCC:

```bash
gcc <filename>.c -o <outputname>  eg: "gcc calculator.c -o calculator"
./<outputname>                        "./calculator"
